# SGX-CMake

CMake file for compiling with Intel SGX.

this is still WIP...

To make compiling code using SGX with CMake easier, a single SGX.cmake file is provided for the purpose.

This code example is from official Intel SGX sample [Cxx11SGXDemo](https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx/tree/master/SampleCode/Cxx11SGXDemo).

Please refer to the CMakeLists.txt file for how to use SGX.cmake file.
